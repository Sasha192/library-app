# <a name="purpose"></a>Project purpose
This is a very basic functional library application, written in Java using plain Spring Framework with a 3-layer architecture (i.e. model --> service --> controller). The model is described by Entities, that are mapped on tables in a MySQL relational database.

You are free to use it as a template for your own online shop software. In current implementation you can add, remove and modify books, users, roles and authers, as well as rent books and return them. The application provides registration and login procedures.
